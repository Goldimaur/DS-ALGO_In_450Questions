Given an array of size n and a number k, find all elements that appear more than n/k times
Given an array of size n, find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times.
 For example, if the input arrays is {3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3} and k is 4, then the output should be [2, 3].
 Note that size of array is 8 (or n = 8), so we need to find all e
